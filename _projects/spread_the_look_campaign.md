*The biggest beauty convention in Europe - GLOW.*

I was responsible for promoting #spreadthelook campaign in "our" countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina). So first of all I had to choose the *right influencers* who are going to present the collection. After that I organized all the details for girls to meet me in Stuttgart for the *Glow Beauty Convention*. We were traveling from different countries so we met for a welcome drink in Germany an evening before the event. My team was just amazing, ladies (__Ajda Sitar, MaÅ¡a Zibar, Jenny Martin, Samra MenziloviÄ‡__) clicked at a hello so we kind of rule on the event. We also had the opportunity to meet the international influencers who were the actual face of the campaign - __Melina (Germany), Kim (Austria), Marta Lozano (Spain), Noor (Netherland), Leomie (UK)__.

In short, social media was *on fire* with our photos, videos and indeed we did spread the look!ðŸ˜Š So, all eyes on us we got home satisfied and happy for one more experience.
