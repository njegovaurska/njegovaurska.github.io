In each of our countries we launch our new collection to __media, press, influencers and our customers.__ With a help of our local PR agencies I determine location, time, budget, theme, who to invite and then the event happen.

I try to travel to every event to stay in contact with the local media, influencers and of course to set all the details with our PR agencies which are needed after the event.

Because beside the event we then plan the vigorous marketing and communication campaigns to achieve *visibility, meet sales forecasts and cultivate customer loyalty*.
